# BST 270 Final Individual Project

This repository is for my final project for BST 270. It attempts to reproduce the graph and table from FiveThirtyEight's [The Best NBA Players, According To RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/)

### Project Structure

The entire project is in `./nba.Rmd`. `.Rmd` is an RMarkdown file and can be compiled using RStudio or VSCode. There is also an html version of the final product called `./nba.html`.
